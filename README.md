# Demo Code for the Course: Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

This repo is about some toy code from the course DSA, including:

- linear structures
  - sequence list
  - vector
  - linked list
  - sequence stack
  - linked stack
- semi-linear structures
  - TBD...
- non-linear structures
  - TBD...
- simple algorithms
  - TBD...
  
 The code is written in C with C11 supported, and is organized by CMake.
